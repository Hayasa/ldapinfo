# Introduction #
Awesome ldapInfoShow is a Thunderbird addon that show contact photo and other info from LDAP for intranet, search avatar in social networks like Facebook, LinkedIn, Flickr, Google+, Gravatar from internet

# LDAP Support #
ldapInfoShow try to use the LDAP servers in Thunderbird's address book. If either of the Name/Hostname/Base DN contains the domain name of email address, then the LDAP server will be used for searching.
    
If you believe the LDAP server should return someone but it errors out "no match", then you should play with the  filter template in 'LDAP settings' for the addon. By default, it's:

`(|(mail=%(email)s)(mailLocalAddress=%(email)s))`

The filter will be `(|(mail=username@company.com)(mailLocalAddress=username@company.com)` for your searching, which means either the mail or mailLocalAddress should be username<span></span>@company.com.

For DavMail LDAP server, the filter should like `'(uid=%(uid)s)'`, and DavMail won't provide avatars.

# LinkedIn Support ( NOT working any more )#
  1. First need to enable it in Option, and click 'OK' for the warning confirmation. ![https://github.com/wangvisual/ldapinfo/blob/master/wiki_images/confirm.png](https://github.com/wangvisual/ldapinfo/blob/master/wiki_images/confirm.png)

# Performance #
  1. The more places you enabled, it take more time to load
  1. Flickr/Gravar can only query 1 email at a time, and Flickr server is slow.
  1. Facebook/LinkedIn/LDAP support batch query and it can save overall query time, but takes more time to load the 1st one.
  1. Facebook/LinkedIn will query 25 emails at most in one query.
  1. LDAP batch query limit is configurable in option dialog and only works when your query filter is simple, eg '(|(mail=%(email)s)(mailLocalAddress=%(email)s))'
  1. You can also limit the total number of email addresses queried for one mail.

# Privacy #
  1. The email addresses sent to Facebook/LinkedIn/Gravatar will be hashed first.
  1. Flickr uses plain email address but transfer through https.
  1. LDAP search uses plain email address.
  1. Facebook/LinkedIn support are using Microsoft Outlook Connectors way of searching, so you will see the authorization to MOC in your Facebook/LinkedIn settings.

# Future #
  1. Support Twitter? If anyone can tell me how.
  1. Xing? Maybe.
  1. Support X-Face/Face header? No, they're obsolete.

# Tips #
  1. You can try to install addon that can sync your gmail contact to local address-book and config this addon to load avatar from it.
