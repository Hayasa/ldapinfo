# Awesome ldapInfoShow

Show contact photo and other info from Local Dir, Addressbook, LDAP, Flickr, Gravatar etc.

This Add-on can read jpegPhoto and other entries from LDAP servers and then show it in mails pane, compose window and address book.

It can helps you to know your colleagues and prevent sending email to wrong person.

Requires a working LDAP server and config it in Thunderbird's Address Book.

It use the same method as Outlook Social Connectors so you can have avatars from Facebook & LinkedIn users too.
